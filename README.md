###### Gdansk University of Technology: Manycore Architectures Project

Parallel Monte Carlo Tree Search using Xeon Phi device
======

This project is an attempt to understand, implement, parallelize Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm and investigate it's performance on _Intel Xeon Phi_ device. Whole exercise is done for Manycore Architectures classes at Gdansk University of Technology.
